# University-Management-System

The project is web based application in java programming which consists of a university management system, that handles various things from user-management (students/teachers).

The basic idea is to incorporate a correct process into the system. Registration, student details, teacher details, fee structure, attendance, exam records, and student performance are just a few of the features offered in our present system. The administrator manually removes all of these actions.
